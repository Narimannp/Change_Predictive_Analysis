# Change Magnitude Analysis
This is a section of my project; data driven analysis of change orders
In this section my main focuse is on the Magnitude of COs

##Purpose
The porpuse of this study is to investigate the predictability of change orders.
Also To explore the attributes with highest contribution in the occurance and severity of change orders.

##Steps
